# IE482-SP24-PROJECT

REPO FOR JACK WUERFEL AND THOMAS ALLAN'S IE482 PROJECT

##Idea 1 - DrinkBot

- what do you plan to do?  We want to use the UR5 robot arm as an automated bartender.  We plan on utilizing Whisper AI or Llama Index for the robot to take in voice commands, translate that to a pre-assigned location of the speified drink, and have the arm carefully grab/transport that drink to the user at the bar.

- why should anyone care? (motivation).  Our motivation is getting robo-crunk.  But in all seriousness, we've seen a progression towards automation at restaurants and other service industries within the past five years.  A robot bartender could potentially free up staff to perform other duties that the robot can't do yet (saying YET because the robot may eventually be able to take payments for drinks, detect and clean spills, and recognize regular patrons.  Imagine if Sam Malone from "Cheers!" was a robot.)

- how do you plan to accomplish this?  The first thing to do is set up a virtual world in Gazebo.  This world would have the UR5, a bar, and a shelf that contains bottles
